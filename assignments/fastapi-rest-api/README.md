# 📘 Assignment: Building REST APIs with FastAPI

## 🎯 Objective

Learn how to build and test RESTful APIs using the FastAPI framework in Python. You will create endpoints, handle requests, and return JSON responses for a simple data model.

## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️ Task 1: Set Up FastAPI Project

#### Description
Initialize a new FastAPI project and create a basic API endpoint that returns a welcome message.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
- Create a main application file (e.g., main.py)
- Define a root endpoint (`/`) that returns a JSON welcome message

### 🛠️ Task 2: Create CRUD Endpoints

#### Description
Add endpoints to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for a simple resource (e.g., items or users).

#### Requirements
Completed program should:
- Define a data model using Pydantic
- Implement endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting resources
- Return appropriate JSON responses for each operation
- Handle errors gracefully (e.g., resource not found)
